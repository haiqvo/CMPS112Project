This game is even more simple than the Java version becasue after many hours of working we were not 
able to get complex version on haskell as we have wanted. More on this topic will be discussed on 
the write including the reason. Overall in this very there are no Arrowers and ScatterSquad, in this
one we have the Sworder face off and if the commander dies that the squad dies. There was also no 
actually parser and to get squad you must go into main.hs and in the top part in squad1 and squad2 edit 
the squads roster.

How to Run
make sure you have the main.hs and simply type ghc main.hs to run.

How to play
Go into the main.hs and manually edit squad1 and squad2 there are instuction in the file.
but here you go 

-- So after so much tear were shed this program work in it very basic form and there was no time 
-- for a parser that takes from file sorry. So I already have a sample squad but to make more 
-- should have to know some things. 
-- (Sworder a b c d e f)
-- a is the strength this will determine the attack strength and health of the character
-- b is the troopId this is unique to the Sworder 
-- c is the squadId and it the same across Sworders of the same squad
-- d is the side and for squad1 please use 1 and squad two please use 2
-- e is the isCommander and should be zero unless it is the commander (note commander should be at the end of squads)
-- f is the damageTaken and should be zero at the beginning
